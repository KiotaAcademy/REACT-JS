# useCallback

The useCallback hook provides another way to memoize a value, not just any value like useMemo. It can only memoize a function.

useReducer is a React hook that is used for managing state and handling complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to the more commonly used useState hook. The useReducer hook takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.
