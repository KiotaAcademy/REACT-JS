# useCallback

The useCallback hook provides another way to memoize a value, not just any value like useMemo. It can only memoize a function.

useReducer is a React hook that is used for managing state and handling complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to the more commonly used useState hook. The useReducer hook takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

useCallback is a hook provided by React that is used to optimize the performance of functional components by memoizing functions, especially those that are passed as props to child components. It's particularly useful when dealing with scenarios where a component renders frequently, and you want to prevent unnecessary re-renders due to the recreation of function references.
