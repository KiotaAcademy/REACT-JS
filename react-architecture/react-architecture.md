math library might have calls like:

1. max
2. min
3. floor
4. ceiling
5. log
6. trunc

react is two libraries:

1. react
2. react-dom

A framework is a collection of programming tools with a specific goal in mind.

A framework is in control of the flow of your program whilst with libraries you have full control and all you get to do is to call this libraries where you need them.

react is a library, nextjs is a framework built on top of react library.
