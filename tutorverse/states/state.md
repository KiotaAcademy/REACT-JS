# STATES

Any exciting application you build is likely to change over the time the user is exploring it.

The changes could be as simple as toggling a dropdown menu or as complex as fetching data from an API.

React provides primitives to manipulate the state of your apps, more specifically components, to make them dynamic. In this lesson, we will learn how to use state in React.

*state is a component's memory* - we need components to remember things about themselves. components along the way may change how they appear and relate with each other.
