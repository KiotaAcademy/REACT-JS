# REACT JS

React is one of the most powerful, widely used frontend frameworks.

React Js allows for:

1. reusability of component
2. well supported
3. it is not opinionated

Applications built with React are made with (reusable) components. Components are your “building blocks.”

the current way of setting up react application is `npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react`
