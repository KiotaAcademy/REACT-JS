# REACT STATES

the are about 8 ways to handle states in react

1. URL - used for tracking where the user is currently in the app (You store things like the current item being viewed, filters, pagination, sorting)
2. Web storage - persisting state between reloads and reboots, that is cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB
3. Local state - this is a local component state, it includes things like forms, toggles, local lists
4. Lifted State - lifting states to a common parent component and then pass it to child components using props
5. Derived state - inferring states from already existing states
6. Refs - DOM reference, uncontrolled components
7. Context - avoid passing props
8. Third party library
